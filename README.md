# didx
Executes scripts/programs against any supported Docker Engine version within the current Docker Engine host environment.  It facilitates configuring a 'Docker In Docker' (dind) server container with its own local repository and an associated docker client container.

Use didx to easily create a Docker test environment that's automatically destroyed after all tests successfully complete.
